# ur16e-tcp-control

This is a repo for controlling the bimanual UR16e arms simultaneously using sockets. It is largely adapted from the [FlingBot](https://flingbot.cs.columbia.edu/) code originally written for controlling two UR5 arms.

To run this code, install all required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and run `python test_pair_move.py`.

I am also currently working on a wrapper for gym environments for real world RL training.
